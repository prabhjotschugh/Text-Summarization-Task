# Text Summarization (Abstractive)

In Text Summarization project powered by the T5 model, we explore the fascinating world of natural language processing to condense lengthy texts into concise summaries. Here's a sneak peek into what this project entails:

## Overview

Text summarization is a vital task in natural language processing, simplifying large volumes of text into shorter, coherent summaries. In this project, we leverage the T5 model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, to automate the summarization process.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preparation:
   - We begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the Samsum dataset, a widely-used benchmark for text summarization tasks.

### 2. Preprocessing:
   - Next, we preprocess the dataset by tokenizing the input articles and summaries, preparing them for input into the T5 model.

### 3. Model Loading:
   - We load the pre-trained T5 model for conditional generation, a powerful tool for generating summaries based on input text.

### 4. Summarization Function:
   - With the model in place, we define a summarization function that takes input text and generates a concise summary using the T5 model.

### 5. Summarization Testing:
   - To ensure the effectiveness of our summarization function, we test it on sample articles, comparing the generated summaries with the original ones.

### 6. Evaluation:
   - Evaluating the quality of generated summaries is crucial. We employ the ROUGE metric, a standard measure in text summarization, to assess the performance of our model.

### 7. Fine-Tuning:
   - For further refinement, we provide an option for fine-tuning the model using the Trainer class, allowing customization to specific tasks or datasets.

### 8. Re-evaluation:
   - Post-augmentation, we re-evaluate the model using the ROUGE metric to gauge its enhanced performance.

## Results

ðŸ“Š The project culminates in comprehensive evaluation results, showcasing the model's proficiency in summarizing text across various metrics. Dive into the notebook to explore the intricacies of text summarization and unleash the power of the T5 model in simplifying complex textual content!








# Text Summarization (Extractive)

In Text Summarization project using spaCy, we delve into the world of natural language processing to extract meaningful summaries from lengthy texts. Here's a sneak peek into what this project entails:

## Overview

Text summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing, condensing large volumes of text into shorter, coherent summaries. In this project, we utilize spaCy, a robust NLP library, to automate the extractive summarization process.

## Key Steps

### 1. Dependency Installation:
   - We start by installing the necessary libraries, including spaCy and tabulate, and downloading the English language model for spaCy.
   
### 2. Text Processing:
   - Next, we define the text to be summarized and process it using spaCy to tokenize the text and calculate word frequencies.

### 3. Sentence Scoring:
   - We then score each sentence based on the frequencies of the words it contains to identify the most important sentences.

### 4. Summary Generation:
   - With the scores computed, we generate the extractive summary by selecting the top sentences.

### 5. Result Formatting:
   - Finally, we format the summary and original text into a structured table using the tabulate library.

## Results

ðŸ“Š The project culminates in generating extractive summaries that capture the essence of the original text. The results are displayed in a structured table format for clarity. The summary model is saved as a pkl file for easy integration into web applications.
